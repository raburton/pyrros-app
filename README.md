# Pyrros Android App
Android app to control B&amp;Q Pyrros ceiling light / bluetooth speaker. B&Q still sell these lights, and they're pretty good, but the original app for them is obsolete.

This app provides the ability to dim the light or turn it off (and back on again) if you just want to use the speaker functionality. You can also rename the light, which is handy if you have more than one of them.

The code here is for reference or if you want to customise the app. The compiled app will hopefully be in the Play Store soon.
